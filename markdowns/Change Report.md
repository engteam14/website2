# Requirements

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">8948b74: Removed Unnecessary requirements</span>**

We felt that some of the requirements the team had previously implemented did not appear in any brief, weren’t asked for by the customer or were just deemed to be redundant. For example the requirements ‘FR_BOSS_UNLOCK_TRACKING’ and ‘FR_BOSS_SPAWN’ involved the use of a boss that was not mentioned in the brief nor customer interviews and therefore had no justification to appear in requirements. This will change R14 as the estimation of the scope of the project would be significantly increased if these requirements were left in.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ef9f295: Added requirements relevant to the second stage of the assessment</span>**

Updated the requirements page to include the new requirements that we received in the brief. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">9845cef: Fixed Formatting</span>**

Fixed formatting mistakes made when editing the markdown table for requirements.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">E1a2386 & 396806d: Changes to priority for requirements</span>**

We felt that the use of ‘shall’ and ‘May’ were redundant measures of a requirement’s priority and didn't help management of requirements. For this reason, we changed the priorities of the requirements to high/medium/low which we feel is a clearer measure for anyone reading and helps justify why we went in specific directions with our implementation.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">6ec20bc: Changed word ‘money’ to ‘plunder’ to match wording in the code</span>**

We noticed some inconsistencies in wording between the documentation and implementation sides of this project. Most notably, in the documentation section the word ‘money’ is consistently used while in the code this same thing is referred to as ‘plunder’. Not only did we feel that ‘plunder’ fit the theme but it was also the word used in the brief which led us to change the documentation in favour of keeping consistency. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">9917596: Cleared up points/XP confusion</span>**

A further inconsistency we noted was the lack of clarity between ‘points’ and ‘XP’ which was pointed out in the feedback as an issue. The team felt it was best to merge the two so we ended up merging the two and using ‘XP’ for both.
