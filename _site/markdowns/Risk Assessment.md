## Risk assessment and mitigation

The risks to the project are presented in the table below, with the following information about each one: 



* An ID- to identify individual risks
* Category type- helps to read the table quickly and find the specific risks
* Description- details what the risk is 
* Potential consequence- explains what could go wrong and why this risk needs solving
* Monitoring- shows whether the risk is happening, indicating if it is of immediate concern
* Likelihood and severity- allows the team to make a judgement about how much of a priority this risk is in solving or preventing
* Mitigation - details the steps that need to be, or are being taken to prevent the risk from happening. 
* Owner- shows who is responsible for either solving the problem or arranging for it to be solved

There is significant detail about the risks to the programming and game itself because each item can affect the overall game, and are distinct issues. The likelihood and severity of the risks are also included because this tells us which risk to prioritise in mitigating, and each item has an ‘owner’- without one, the responsibility can be unclear, causing the issue to not be solved.
