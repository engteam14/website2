<ol>
  <li>The provided product brief indicated the overall goals and intentions of the finished product and contained general descriptions of its desired functionality</li>
  <li>Group brainstorming session was held to compare our interpretations of the brief and to raise a list of questions to address to the customer</li>
  <li>In a group meeting with the customer, answers to the questions and any other customer comments were detailed in informal meeting notes.</li>
  <li>Recorded info was formalised as a set of user requirements.</li>
  <li>User requirements were distilled down into more specific functional and non-functional requirements.
    <ol>
      <li>Functional requirements detailed concrete, specific functionality and capabilities of the product as related to its software implementation.</li>
      <li>Non-functional requirements captured the performative characteristics of the completed product as a whole which could be perceived by the user or tester.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Resulting functional and non-functional requirements were closely evaluated for possible risks to their implementation; these were detailed within the risk register.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="research-into-requirement-specification-and-presentation">Research into requirement specification and presentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>IEEE requirements engineering document<sup>1</sup>:
    <ul>
      <li>Provided comprehensive information on all aspects of requirement elicitation and presentation, although sections 5.1-5.2.8 and 6.1-6.6.3 were most helpful</li>
      <li>Contained robust justification for the need for requirements and their role in the overall software lifecycle process</li>
      <li>Informed our choice of specific language, priority language(low/medium/high), the choice of imperative tone, and justifications for these</li>
      <li>Ultimately, aimed at larger, more critical projects than ours</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ENG1 lecture on requirements engineering:
    <ul>
      <li>Provided an excellent overview of the motivations for requirements engineering and a lucid overview of this process</li>
      <li>Introduced the user/functional/non-functional requirements methodology which proved an excellent fit for our scope of project (versus lifecycle-based requirement methodology in the IEEE document)</li>
      <li>Demonstrated requirements tables as a tool for writing down and detailing requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Informed by these resources, we chose a tabular format for implementing for the requirements register, allowing us to easily add additional metadata to individual rows as extra columns and permitting a quick, comprehensive overview of the entire register. All rows were labeled with unique identifiers, permitting cross-referencing between user and</p>

    <p>(non-)functional requirements, as well as with other sections of project documentation, such as the risk register and architecture specs.</p>
